Constructors:

Constructors should not do complex tasks as this will affect on the performane of the system
Constructors should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.

ngOnInit():The ngOnInit() is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit() shortly after creating a component. 
It's a good place to put initialization logic.
Use ngOnInit() for two main reasons:

To perform complex initializations shortly after construction.
To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties.

An ngOnInit() is a good place for a component to fetch its initial data.

call ngOnInit() as soon as component is created as it does initialization.
ngOnInit() runs only once.

Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. 
Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.
